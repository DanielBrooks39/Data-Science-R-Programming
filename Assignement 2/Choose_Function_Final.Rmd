#This program will be used to calculate the choose function (nCr). It taked the total population "n" and
#picks a subpopulation "r" from that population. It them calculates how many possible combinations are
#there for picking "r" objects from "n" total objects (order doesn't matter)

#readpopulation function has no parameters being passed to it and returns an integer value:
     #Promots the user to enter in the total popluation for the problem
     #Returns the population that was entered by the user
readpopulation <- function()
{
  population <- readline(prompt = "Please enter the total poplulation: ")
  return(population) 
}

#A variable that will hold the input from the readpopulation function
pr <- as.integer(readpopulation())

#readchoice function has no parameters being passed to it and returns an integer value
     #Prompts the user to enter in the amount they would like to choose from the total population
     #Returns the amount the user chose out of the total population
readchoice <- function()
{
  choice <- readline(prompt = "Please enter the choice of of the total population: ")
  return(choice)
}

#A variable that will hold the input from the readchoice function

#factorial function will take one parameter being passed to it and returns an integer value
     #This function will calculate the fatorial (!) of the value that is passed to it
          #factorial is defined as: n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)....*(2)*(1)
     #It initialzes the solution to 1 (fact)
     #It takes the soultion and multiplies it by the number that was passed into the function (x)
     #Then we subtract 1 from the number being passed into the function
     #The process is repeated until x is one (we do not need to multiply by one because it doesn't change the answer)
factorial <- function(x)
{
  fact <- 1
  while (x > 1)

#Diffactorial function will take two parameters being passed to it and returns an integer value
     #This function will calculate the fatorial (!) of the difference of the two values passed to it
          #Factorial is defined as: n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)....*(2)*(1)
     #Take the differnece of the two values that are passed to it (diff)
     #It initialzes the solution to 1 (fact)
     #It takes the soultion and multiplies it by the number that was passed into the function (x)
     #Then we subtract 1 from the number being passed into the function
     #The process is repeated until x is one (we do not need to multiply by one because it doesn't change the answer)

}
  
#Choose function will take in two parameters being pased to it and calculate the combination of the two numbers
     #The function will calculate the combination of the two numbers that were inputted from the user
     #It will take the factorial of the population (factorial(x)) and divide it by the factorial of the 
          #difference of the population and the number of choices (Diffactorial(x,y)) times the factorial
          #of the number of choices (factorial(y)).
     #It will give the anser for the total number of combinations for the number of choices out of a given 
     #population.

{

#Here is the test of the functions that I made.
     #I did 48C33 and got the answer below.
#I then did the actual function that is within R to check my answer
     #The two answers are correct, which means my function must be correct as well.
```

```{r}
pr <- as.integer(readpopulation())
Please enter the total poplulation: 48
cr <- as.integer(readpopulation())
Please enter the total poplulation: 33
Choosefinal(pr,cr)
1.09326e+12
choose(48,33)
1.09326e+12
